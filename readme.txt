A Plugin for Accepting Donations.

== Description ==
The top selling WordPress plugin now has a feature-rich free version. Total Donations was built with a focus on productivity and ease-of-use to get things done fast for your non-profit, church or political organization. 


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
  Q: How do I start? 
  A: After installing and activating the plugin, go to either PayPal or Stripe and setup the gateway(s) you'd like to use. Next you'll need to arrange the form. Go to TotalDonations > campaigns > form > multi-campaign form. There you'll be able to add new fields and customize the form the way you need them. After you have set that up, head over to the email page and set up your auto-reply 'thank yous' and the email addresses to notify upon a successful donation. 
  Once you have it set up correctly, paste the shortcode [totaldonations] inside the page you'd like the form to show up on and then run some tests. You can also add as many campaigns as you'd like.
